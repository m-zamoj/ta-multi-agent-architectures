# A Multi-Agent System Architecture for Social Simulation

This repository accompanies the Master's thesis on psychologically grounded multi-agent systems based on Transactional Analysis (TA).

The thesis investigates how Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents can simulate structured interpersonal dynamics by incorporating TA constructs such as ego states, transactional games, and life scripts into agent architectures.
